#C Testing Framework

This Bash-based framework has been developed to streamline the testing process for C source code. The framework efficiently traverses a designated folder structure to detect, compile, and execute C files, ensuring an automated and reliable testing process.

##📌 Key Features

###🔍 Automatic Detection & Compilation: Scans the ex_c.sh/ folder hierarchy to find and compile C source code.

###⚡ Execution & Output Management: Runs the compiled binaries and stores the results in the ex_c.sh/Output/ directory.

###✅ Validation & Accuracy Checking: Compares exit codes and outputs of executed programs against predefined check files to verify correctness.
